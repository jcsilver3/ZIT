# ZIT
Zero Intelligence Traders

This is a Swift implementation based on the work of Gode & Sunder (1993) and later adaptations by Robert Axtell (1998-2015). This is implemented as a Swift Playground, requiring Mac Catalyst 17.5, iOS 17.5/macOS 14.5.

The ZeroIntelligenceTraders.swiftpm.zip package file may me opened directly in MacOS Swift Playgrounds and contains all the necessary files (ContentView.swift, ZeroIntelligenceTraders.swift and ZitApp.swift).

Playground has been tested on a Macbook Pro M1 Max 64GB running Sequoia 15.1.1 and iPad Pro 11" 3rd Gen on iPadOS 18.1.1.
